# TechnoVisionFormatter
What is Does:

It takes everything in input.txt and removes all colons, spaces, and newlines then saves it to output.txt
If you want to see exactly how it works look at the source code (it's pretty simple)


Instructions:

Download the project and extract it.
Put Formatter.py somewhere.
In the same folder as Formatter.py create a text file and name it input.txt and paste the key in there.
Put an ! at the end of input.txt.
Open Terminal and cd to the folder that Formatter.py is in.
Run the command `python3 Formattter.py`.
It should generate a file called output.txt.
Remove the ! from output.txt and copy the text.
