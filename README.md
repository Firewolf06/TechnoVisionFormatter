# TechnoVisionFormatter
Usage:

Download the project and extract it.
Put Formatter.py somewhere.
In the same folder as Formatter.py create a text file and name it input.txt and paste the key in there.
Put an ! at the end of input.txt.
Open Terminal and cd to the folder that Formatter.py is in.
Run the command `python3 Formattter.py`.
It should generate a file called output.txt.
Remove the ! from output.txt and copy the text.

Feel free to edit the code and re-upload it anywhere. I don't reaaly care if you give me credit.
